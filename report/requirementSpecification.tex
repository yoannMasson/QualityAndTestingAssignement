\chapter{Introduction}

Nowadays high powerfull computer is highly interesting for industries and research. To stay on top of the game, Cranfield University is purchasing a new super computer. It will be used by a large number of users ( students, researchers, etc...), so a good ressources management and a good billing policy is mandatory. In order to achieve these goals, a simulation of the new job control system is requiered. 

This document will stated the requirement specifications of the simulation of the new job control system. The software shall allow IT supports to run different simulations of the job scheduler for the new supercomputer and shall keep track of the accounting state at any point in time. The simulation shall model the behaviour of the computing platform to explore alternative accounting strategies.
The requirements should be well explained and not subject to any interpretation.



\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.  
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product 
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
$<$Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the 
hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software 
components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.$>$

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, 
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any 
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$
\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
The simulation will run on parameters set by users. All settings will be stored and can be changed in a provided file. When executing the simulation this file must be given as a parameter of the executable for the settings to be taken in account. Parameters will go from the number user to the accounting settings and the number/frequency of jobs.\\
If no file is provided, default settings will be applied. Those default settings can be found as an appendix of this document.\\
The output of the simulation shall be printed on the console executing the simulation.


\chapter{System Features}

\section{User Management}


\subsection{Description}
Simulated users are the heart of the system since they are the one making job requests. They are dividing into three groups :
\begin{itemize}
\item students
\item researchers
\item IT Supports
\end{itemize}
Each user is entitled budget, IT Supports get unlimited budget while students have a budget depending on their Msc. Every researcher has financial ressources according to their groups, some of them can have additional ressources.\\
Student will be separate evenly between these 3 Msc: Computer, Water, Soil.

\subsection{Settings from the input files}
The settings that can be changed through the settings file are:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{User variable}
\begin {tabular}{ l l l}
\toprule
Variable & Default Value & Description \\
\midrule
\midrule
 STUDENT_NUMBER & 60  & the number of student considered in the simulation \\
 RESEARCHER_NUMBER & 20 & the number of researcher considered in the simulation \\
 COMPUTER_BUDGET & 20.00  & Budget attribut to one student from Computer Msc \\
 WATER_BUDGET & 10.00  & Budget attribut to one student from Water Msc \\
