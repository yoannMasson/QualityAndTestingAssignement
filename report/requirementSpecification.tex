\chapter{Introduction}

Nowadays high powerful computer is highly interesting for industries and research. To stay on top of the game, Cranfield University is purchasing a new super computer. It will be used by a large number of users ( students, researchers, etc...), so a good resources management and a good billing policy is mandatory. In order to achieve these goals, a simulation of the new job control system is required. 

This document will stated the requirement specifications of the simulation of the new job control system. The software shall allow IT supports to run different simulations of the job scheduler for the new supercomputer and shall keep track of the accounting state at any point in time. The simulation shall model the behaviour of the computing platform to explore alternative accounting strategies.
The requirements should be well explained and not subject to any interpretation.



\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Functions}

The simulation will randomly create jobs based on an exponential distribution law, meaning that the resources needed and the time needed to run the job will depends on parameters given by the real user of the simulation. The cost of running a job is up to these two parameters.\\
As in real life, the job system control simulation will have various type of user with each having a different budget, users that can't pay for a job running will not be able to see their job running as it would be on real life.\\
All the ressources shall be split between three queue:\begin{itemize}
\item small queue, 20\% of all cores working on small jobs ( less than 2 nodes and 1 hour )
\item medium queue, 30\% of all cores working for medium jobs ( less than 10\% of all cores and less than 8h)
\item large queue, 50\% of all cores working on large jobs (less than 50\% of all cores and less than 16h)
\end{itemize}
Every other jobs will run on the week-end (from friday 17:00 to monday 9:00 ), where all the queue are not working to let the huge queue works with huge jobs that can take up to 48h and all resources.\\
The queuing system shall work on the first come/first serve strategy, the firsts job to request resources will be given the resources until there is not enough resources for the next job that will needs to wait for one to finish.

\section{Interaction between classes}
Classes work together, here is a data flow model to briefly see the interactions between them.\\INSERT DATA FLOW

\section{Operating Environment}
The simulation shall run under Java 1.7 in a terminal or in Eclipse by importing the project. For the simulation to take in account the settings file you must provide it as an argument when lauching the programm.


\section{User Documentation}
The software shall be delivered with the document of the class composing the project. This documentation shall be generate with javadoc, providing comments about methods, argument, return statement and exceptions


\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
The simulation will run on parameters set by users. All settings will be stored and can be changed in a provided file. When executing the simulation this file must be given as a parameter of the executable for the settings to be taken in account. Parameters will go from the number user to the accounting settings and the number/frequency of jobs.\\
If no file is provided, default settings will be applied. Those default settings can be found later in this document.\\
The output of the simulation shall be printed on the console executing the simulation.


\chapter{System Features}

\section{User Management}


\subsection{Description}
Simulated users are the heart of the system since they are the one making job requests. They are dividing into two groups :
\begin{itemize}
\item students
\item researchers
\end{itemize}
Each user is entitled budget, students have a budget depending on their Msc. Every researcher has financial resources according to their groups, some of them can have additional resources.\\
Student will be separate evenly between these 3 Msc: Computer, Water, Soil.

\subsection{Settings from the input files}
The settings that can be changed through the settings file are:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{User variable}
\begin {tabular}{ l l l}
\toprule
Variable & Default Value & Description \\
\midrule
\midrule
 STUDENT_NUMBER & 60  & the number of student considered in the simulation \\
 RESEARCHER_NUMBER & 20 & the number of researcher considered in the simulation \\
 COMPUTER_BUDGET & 20.00  & Budget attribute to one student from Computer Msc \\
 WATER_BUDGET & 10.00  & Budget attribute to one student from Water Msc \\
 SOIL_BUDGET & 5.00  & Budget attribute to one student from Soil Msc \\
 RESEARCHER_BUDGET & 50.00  & Budget attribute to one researcher \\
\bottomrule
\end {tabular}
\end{table}
Every variable must be greater or equal than 0

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Here is the list of functional requirement that the class user must provide:\begin{itemize}
    \item A user must be able to tell at any moment his budget
    \item A user must be able to give his status (Msc, researcher) at any moment
    \item A user must be able to pay for a job
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
If a user can not pay for a job, he is not charged for it. He must notice the caller of the pay method with an exception stating that the user does not have enough budget

\section{Resource Management}


\subsection{Description}
With this feature, the user can manage the power of the simulated computing system. The changes that can be made are about the numbers of nodes, the price of using these nodes and the cost for the IT department for running the super computer. 
\subsection{Settings from the input files}
The settings that can be changed through the settings file are:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Computing variable}
\begin {tabular}{ l l l}
\toprule
Variable & Default Value & Description \\
\midrule
\midrule
NODES_PROCESSOR_NUMBER & 80  & the number of traditional nodes\\
ACCELERATED_PROCESSOR_NUMBER & 40  & the number of accelerated nodes\\ 
SPECIALIZED_NUMBER & 20  & the number of specialized nodes considered \\
SMALL_PRICE & 0.05  & the price of one machine hour\\&& for computing small jobs. \\
MEDIUM_PRICE & 0.05  & the price of one machine hour\\&& for computing medium jobs. \\
LARGE_PRICE & 0.05 & the price of one machine hour\\&& for computing large jobs. \\
HUGE_PRICE & 0.05  & the price of one machine hour\\&& for computing huge jobs. \\
COMPUTER_COST & 0.01  & the cost for the IT Department\\&& per node\&hour. \\

\bottomrule
\end {tabular}
\end{table}
Every variable must be greater or equal than 0. There must be at least 128 nodes in total.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}


\section{Simulation Management}

\subsection{Description}
In this section, we will see the parameters that can be set to manage the simulation. First we need to manage the job generation. Jobs are generated with an exponential distribution with parameters depending on the user settings. We can change the duration of the simulation, the more time the more jobs are submitted throughout the entire simulation.
\subsection{Settings from the input files}
The settings that can be changed through the settings file are:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Computing variable}
\begin {tabular}{ l l l }
\toprule
Variable & Default Value & Description \\
\midrule
\midrule
ENTIRE_TIME & 8 & the number of weeks the simulation will last \\
DELTA_SIZE & 1 & the value of delta used in the exponential distribution \\&& to generate the size of a job\\
DELTA_JOB_TIME & 1 & the value of delta used in the exponential distribution\\&& to generate the time needed to run a job\\
DELTA_REQUEST_TIME & 1 & the value of delta used in the exponential \\&& distribution to generate the time between \\&& two consecutive jobs\\ 

\bottomrule
\end {tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
In any case, jobs shall last between 1 minute and 48 hours. The time between two consecutive job requests shall not exceed 4 hours. Jobs shall not asked for more than the number of nodes in the queue.
